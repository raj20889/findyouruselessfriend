- For the 'boys theme', use a bold, tech-style font like 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif). For the 'girls theme', use a playful, rounded font like 'Poppins' (sans-serif).
- Use geometric shapes for the 'boys theme' and hearts, sparkles, and playful shapes for the 'girls theme'.
- Implement a fully responsive design with a modern glassmorphism style and gradient backgrounds.
- Use smooth animations when switching between the 'boy' and 'girl' themes, as well as hover effects with playful micro-animations for upload buttons and charts.
